# SleepOutside - BYUI WDD330 Team Project

## Description

This project was developed as part of the **BYUI WDD330** class to **teach collaborative spirit** and encourage teamwork in web development. **SleepOutside** is an e-commerce website that specializes in selling outdoor products for adventurous living. It was built using **Vite**, a fast and efficient web bundler.  

I, **Kolawole Jegede**, was proud to be part of the development team. You can view the hosted project here: [SleepOutside Website](https://thriving-parfait-32c018.netlify.app/).
